# Students

Using one of the patterns described, write the code needed to create 3
student objects. Each student object should have a describe() method
that returns a string that describes the student. Each student will be
described using a full name and a student number. The rest of the
description will be built up based on the studentâ€™s activity at HyperionDev.
For example, the description should explain which Bootcamps the
student has registered for and which level of the Bootcamp has been
completed.

Below is sample output:
       
       Student 1: Susan Smith:
         
         - Registered for the Software Engineering Bootcamp
         
         - Completed level 1
       
       Student 2: Michael Jackson:
         
         - Registered for the Web Development Bootcamp
         
         - Completed level 1
         
         - Completed level 2
         
         - Completed level 3
         
         - Registered for the Software Engineering Bootcamp
       
       Student 3: Saoirse Ronan
         
         - Registered for the Web Development Bootcamp
